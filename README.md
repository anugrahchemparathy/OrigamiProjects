# OrigamiProjects
Implementing some smaller origami projects

Currently this contains a sample one vertex folding demonstration ported over from a Wolfram Demonstrations Project [thing](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/OneVertexOrigamiFolding/) I made a couple years ago.

You can try it ourself on [github](https://anugrahchemparathy.github.io/OrigamiProjects/) or run the slightly altered version on [my website](http://www.mit.edu/~anugrah/index.html).
